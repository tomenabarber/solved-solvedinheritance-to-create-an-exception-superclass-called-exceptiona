Use inheritance to create an exception superclass called ExceptionA and exception subclasses ExceptionB and ExceptionC, where ExceptionB inherits from ExceptionA and ExceptionC inherits from ExceptionB. Write a program to demonstrate how one catch block can catch all three types of exceptions. That is the catch block for type ExceptionA that catches exceptions of types ExceptionB and ExceptionC. The idea here is to have you write and understand exception handling and get a sense of how you might use it in your final project
